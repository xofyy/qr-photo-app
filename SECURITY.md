- Role-based permissions (owner vs. participant)

### Data Protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- File type validation with magic number checking
- File size limits (10MB per upload)
- Path traversal protection
- SQL injection prevention

### Infrastructure Security
- HTTPS enforced in production
- Security headers implementation
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting
- Request size limits

### File Upload Security
- Content-Type validation
- File extension filtering
- Magic number verification
- Virus scanning (recommended)
- Secure file storage (Cloudinary)

### Security Headers
```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

### Environment Security
- Environment variables for secrets
- No hardcoded credentials
- Secure secret management
- Container security scanning

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. Never commit secrets to version control
2. Use environment variables for configuration
3. Validate all user inputs
4. Follow the principle of least privilege
5. Keep dependencies updated
6. Use HTTPS in production

### For Deployment
1. Use secure container images
2. Implement network segmentation
3. Enable logging and monitoring
4. Regular security updates
5. Backup and disaster recovery
6. Security scanning in CI/CD
